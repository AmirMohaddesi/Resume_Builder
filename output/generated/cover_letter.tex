% Greeting
Dear Hiring Manager,

% Body


I am excited to apply for the Sr. Software Developer position at Apple in Cupertino, California. With a robust background in software development, particularly in automated testing and quality assurance, I am eager to contribute to Apple's mission of delivering exceptional software products that enhance user experiences.



In my role as a Research Assistant at the NMI Lab, I developed an 8-bit quantized spiking neural network using PyTorch, optimizing performance for low-power scenarios. This project not only showcased my technical skills but also highlighted my ability to collaborate effectively within interdisciplinary teams, a key aspect of the role at Apple. My experience in fostering stakeholder interactions aligns seamlessly with your emphasis on teamwork and problem-solving.



As a Graduate Researcher at the CARL Lab, I further refined my expertise by creating a multi-robot simulation platform in ROS2, aimed at advancing navigation research. This position involved mentoring undergraduate students, underscoring my commitment to knowledge sharing and collaboration. My proficiency in CI/CD practices and QA processes directly supports your need for building and maintaining robust testing pipelines, ensuring the high-quality software that Apple is known for.



Additionally, I have successfully led projects such as the Multi-Robot Coordination and Distributed Control System, where I enhanced automated testing and implemented comprehensive QA processes to ensure reliability. My work on a Conversational AI project reflects my innovative approach and technical acumen in developing impactful software solutions.



I am particularly inspired by Apple's dedication to innovation and quality, and I am eager to leverage my experience in automated software testing, along with my technical skills in Python, CI/CD, and DevOps, to contribute to your esteemed team.



Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can support Apple's continued success.
